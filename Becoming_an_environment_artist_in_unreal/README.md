Terminology of environment art within game production and unreal

Folder Structure and file nameing

Importing meshes, textures, and assets with unreal properly.

Texture settings density.

Blockout meshes and understanding mesh footprints

Target Audience, junior level or entry level environment artist

The viewer has already installed Unreal Engine.

The topics we will d

Section of this course

Section 1 - Pre-Production 

Section 2 - Tools in Unreal

At end of course good understanding of tools.

## Department Interactions in Development

What are the responsibilites of Environment Artist

Chain of Command

Responsibilites of an Environment Artist

Working Multiple much larger range, 

Studio and size of team, responsibility,

Common responsibilities,

Creating props and assets

Creating textures

Creating materials

Working directly with design and level art to make levels and environments 

Where does I fit in puzzle

There will be different setups, Chain of command, medium to small size team, simple for now. 

Top is Studio Heads

CEO/STUDIO HEAD/PROJECT LEAD

Direction to Art Director 

Guidence

Intermediate designer

Leads and art and design both groups are heading same direction

Goals tasks and deadline 

Supervisor will 

Collaboration with designer, complete level, design and art goals are met.

Chain of command, there are back and forth movements between teams, art director, look of game, environment team inform design decision.

Art direction will give feedback to maintain art direction.

Q and A

Confusing for new artist

Who will be interacting with the most, biggest interaction

Working with Designer 

Level artist

Subgroup with a team , particular level, easy to work with,

Task with designer, creating block out meshes, documentation 

Levels of blockout,

Feedback 

fully assets

Materials for assets for level artist work

Work with outsourecers

Best to keep in mind its common but not assumed

## Team size matter

AAA Studio Larger Team 
Generally more specialized Tasks, larger art team, more resources, slightly less learning of other disiplines, more focused tasking

## AA or Indie Studio/ Midsize Team

Broader Tasks and assignments and more creative control on tasks, mid to small art teams lots of learning of other skills

## Startups and Group/Small Size Teams

Will be Working on Multiple Aspects out of Environment art, typically not a lot of management, good for people that can self manage their time, requires a lot of self discipine, you will learn a lot of things you would have had a chance to try.

As an Arist 

Might be the artist that makes all the trees or tiles sets, high end results with focus,

Coworkers as resources to figure out issues, down side, outside of skill bubble, 

For a slighly smaller team, team sizes will be reduced as well as the budget, in this position as an environment artist, props, textures, landscapes, etc.

Structure of a large company, but ca

Super small team, very different, 1 to 25 members big.

Range, many other art departments, resources will be limited, nice feeling for some,

Working style will be stressful for some, some perfer 

Learn more in this scenario, best task , quality during production

Pros and Cons 

What style works best?

## Names and Terminology

What they mean What applies 

What terms, during production process, later in lessons,few here

Common terminology, Terms of Phrases, anyone in the game design cycle, memebrs of the production team , better communicate,

How you may hear them in context,

Smaller portion of goal,

Smaller goals, Larger result, common process, smaller obtainable goals, preproduction, period of time, 

research and development 

Knowing what applies

What terms mean, during the production process

Later, for lessons,

Lets first talk about common terminology,

Terms or phrases used in production, shared between groups, members of production team, inform you to communicate with ther groups other than your own.

## Sprint or production cycle

Work on it in chuncks, larger result, common process for teams, to reach smaller goals, rather than focus on main goals

## re-Production Prepro

How you might hear it - We have to figure out how this going to work in pre

## Engine 

Unreal engine 

## Build 

Current version of game 

That is being used and tests, currently included in the game, cooking the build, compiling the build for testing, 

## Bug

Problem or issue that has occured within the game or some aspect of development that will need to be addressed or fixed,

Protentially, not desirable

## Certification 

The point of production, console game final release

Often times there is lingo, only relevant to phrases , used during production not exclusive to environment artist.

Inform you with better communication with other environment artist, 

## Bakes or bake down 

Textures or the texturing process 

Details in assets, low poly model, render, more refinded optimized final result, lighting texture map,

## Materials Shaders Mats

Materials that are applied to assets, materials descibe

## mesh Geo

Terms to descibe 3D model that is being used in the engine or for production, a mesh is derived

## Lightmap 

Texture that is generated and applied to assets in the engine that siumulate lighting that is baked prerended 

## LOD 

Abbreviation of the term level of detail

optimiazed version of a mesh that is swapped in

Essential game play

## MIPS

mip maps 

## Similar to LOD

OptimiZation term, redureed size version of texture to save on performace, not essential for game play. 

## Z-Fighting or cliping 

So close to each other they are fiting for screens pace, visually in the asset.

## Culling

Assets is not viewed or shown on screen is not rendered so to aviod rendering unessessary assets and resources to the player

## Blockout 

Terms to define temp or placeholder assets or space to determine playability gameplay mechanics or general flow or look of a level, Many ti

## Drawcalls 

Render information, GPU of computer reciveds a signla or drawcall of assets, each material in scene need to be sent to GPu to be rendered in real time.

## Setting up Folders

Understanding where Unreal saves files 

Proper naming 

Prefixes 

naming folders and assets 

deleting assets

Where will work be saved in unreal, where does it save to?
